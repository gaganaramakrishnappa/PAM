# Pizzas and More

This repository contains the source code for out Database Management Systems Course project 'Pizzas and More'. It includes a pizza delivery website frontend made with HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP including creating new accounts, and ordering either through the account or as a guest to Pizza Hut locations for upto 4 cities with authentication. As a customer, one can order items and put it in the cart, and can also leave an order incomplete and log back in to complete it later. On finalising the order, the site takes you to a dummy payment portal for netbanking, paytm, credit cards, etc. As an admin, one can add new stores or food items and delete the same, view and manipulate employee records on authentication. The DBMS portion uses MySQL.
